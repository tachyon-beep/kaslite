# The Authoritative Guide to the Morphogenetic Seed Lifecycle

This document traces each `SentinelSeed` from its inert birth to its ultimate fate‚Äî**FOSSILIZED** or **CULLED**.

## Lifecycle Path

```text
DORMANT 
  ‚Üí GERMINATED 
    ‚Üí TRAINING 
      ‚Üí (soft-test) ‚Üí GRAFTING 
        ‚Üí STABILIZATION 
          ‚Üí FINE-TUNING 
            ‚Üí (FOSSILIZED or CULLED)
```

### 1. DORMANT (‚ö™)

* **Trigger**
  Initial state at network creation or when a culled seed‚Äôs embargo expires.

* **Behavior**

  * Identity pass-through: `output = x`.
  * Buffers every activation for later training.
  * Controller polls its **health signal** (activation variance) to spot bottlenecks.

* **Next** ‚Üí **GERMINATED** when selected by the controller upon a performance plateau.

---

### 2. GERMINATED (üå±)

* **Trigger**
  Controller calls for germination on the chosen seed.

* **Behavior**

  * Acts as a **parking lot** so seeds train one at a time.
  * Child network weights are re-initialized and set `requires_grad = True`.

* **Next** ‚Üí **TRAINING** when no other seed is actively training.

---

### 3. TRAINING (üü¢) ‚Äì Initial Reconstruction

* **Trigger**
  SeedManager promotes from **GERMINATED**.

* **Behavior**

  * Child network learns to **reconstruct** its buffered activations (MSE loss).
  * Parent network still uses identity pass‚Äîzero impact on existing features.

* **Soft-Test Gate**
  At epoch‚Äôs end, check reconstruction error:

  * **Pass** ‚Üí proceed to **GRAFTING**
  * **Fail** ‚Üí immediately **CULLED** (enter embargo)

---

### 4. GRAFTING (üîó)

* **Trigger**
  Successful soft-test after **TRAINING**.

* **Behavior**

  * Blend factor `Œ±` ramps from 0 ‚Üí 1 over *N* steps.
  * Forward pass:

    ```python
    output = (1 ‚àí Œ±) * x + Œ± * child(x)
    ```

* **Next** ‚Üí **STABILIZATION** once `Œ± ‚âà 1.0`.

---

### 5. STABILIZATION (üõ†)

* **Trigger**
  Completion of **GRAFTING** (`Œ±` at 1.0).

* **Behavior**

  * Hold `Œ± = 1.0` for a handful of epochs with **no** parameter updates.
  * Allows any residual blending artifacts to settle before fine-tuning.

* **Next** ‚Üí **FINE-TUNING**

---

### 6. FINE-TUNING (üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è)

* **Trigger**
  After **STABILIZATION** hold.

* **Behavior**

  * **Live Test:** child‚Äôs residual is fully active: `output = x + child(x)`.
  * **Task Aligned:** switch child training to the model‚Äôs primary loss (e.g. cross-entropy).
  * Controller monitors global metrics (`val_acc`, `val_loss`) during this period.

* **Next** ‚Üí Terminal **FOSSILIZED** if performance improves, or **CULLED** if not.

---

### 7. FOSSILIZED (ü¶¥)

* **Trigger**
  Child raises overall performance during **FINE-TUNING**.

* **Behavior**

  * Freeze the child and **replace** the seed in the graph with a lightweight grafted module.
  * Persist the updated network to disk.

* **Terminal** ‚Üí lifecycle complete.

---

### 8. CULLED (ü•Ä)

* **Trigger**
  Failure at the soft-test (end of **TRAINING**) or final **FINE-TUNING** assessment.

* **Behavior**

  * Seed is marked culled, parameters frozen, slot embarged.
  * No new germinations in this slot for a set number of epochs.

* **Next** ‚Üí After embargo, seed resets to **DORMANT**.

## Why This Matters

1. **Early Cull:** Removes unstable subnets before they touch the backbone.
2. **Clear Grafting + Stabilization:** Smoothly introduces new capacity without sudden jolts.
3. **Task-Aligned Fine-Tuning:** Ensures subnets learn features that actually improve end-task performance.

This refined lifecycle balances **safety** (no abrupt shifts) with **effectiveness** (every gradient step contributes to your true objective).
