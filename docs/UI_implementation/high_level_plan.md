Of course. Here is a detailed, phased tasking statement for wiring up the UI. Each task is designed to be a discrete, verifiable unit of work, allowing for a pause to confirm the implementation before proceeding to the next.

### **Objective:**

To create a robust data pipeline from the `kaslite` backend to the `RichDashboard` UI, ensuring all UI panels (excluding Tamiyo and Karn) are populated with live data from the experiment.

---

### **Phase 1: Standardize Data Payloads & Enhance the Logger**

**Goal:** Establish a single, reliable data bus using `ExperimentLogger` with a well-defined and consistent data contract for all UI-related events.

* **Task 1.1: Define Standardized Event Payloads**
  * **Action:** In `morphogenetic_engine/logger.py`, formally define the dictionary structure for the `data` payload of each `EventType`. These structures should be documented in the method docstrings.
  * **Example Payload Definitions:**
    * `EPOCH_PROGRESS`: `{'val_loss': float, 'val_acc': float, 'train_loss': float, 'epoch': int}`
    * `SEED_STATE_CHANGE`: `{'seed_id': str, 'from': str, 'to': str, 'alpha': float | None, 'drift': float | None}`
    * `PHASE_TRANSITION`: `{'from': str, 'to': str, 'epoch': int, 'total_epochs': int}`
  * **Deliverable:** Updated method docstrings in `logger.py` that clearly document the expected `data` dictionary for each logging method.
  * **Verification:** A manual review of the docstrings in `logger.py` confirms that all data structures required by the UI are clearly defined and consistent.

* **Task 1.2: Refactor Logger Methods to Use Standard Payloads**
  * **Action:** Modify the logging methods (`log_epoch_progress`, `log_seed_event`, etc.) in `morphogenetic_engine/logger.py` to ensure they construct and record `LogEvent` objects using the exact payload structures defined in Task 1.1.
  * **Deliverable:** The modified Python methods within `morphogenetic_engine/logger.py`.
  * **Verification:** Code review confirms that each method correctly assembles the `LogEvent` with the standardized `data` payload. Existing tests for the logger in `tests/test_logger.py` should be updated to assert the structure of these payloads.

---

### **Phase 2: Connect Backend Components to the Logger**

**Goal:** Ensure all components that generate UI-relevant data are correctly calling the enhanced `ExperimentLogger` methods.

* **Task 2.1: Verify `training.py` Integration**
  * **Action:** In `morphogenetic_engine/training.py`, locate the calls to the `ExperimentLogger` within the training and evaluation loops. Ensure they are calling `log_epoch_progress` and `log_seed_event` with all the required data keys as defined in Phase 1.
  * **Deliverable:** The relevant, verified sections of code in `morphogenetic_engine/training.py`.
  * **Verification:** Run a simple experiment (e.g., using `run_morphogenetic_experiment.py`) and inspect the output log file (`events.log`). Confirm that epoch and seed-related events are being logged with the complete, standardized data payloads.

* **Task 2.2: Verify `runners.py` Integration**
  * **Action:** In `morphogenetic_engine/runners.py`, verify that the main experiment runner script logs phase transitions (e.g., "warm-up" -> "adaptation") using the `log_phase_transition` method at the correct points in the experiment lifecycle.
  * **Deliverable:** The verified sections of code in `morphogenetic_engine/runners.py`.
  * **Verification:** Inspect the `events.log` file after a test run to ensure `PHASE_TRANSITION` events are present and contain the correct `from`, `to`, and `total_epochs` data.

---

### **Phase 3: Implement the UI Data Consumer**

**Goal:** Prepare the `RichDashboard` to receive and process data by implementing consumer methods and the dispatch logic.

* **Task 3.1: Implement Data Storage and Consumer Methods in `RichDashboard`**
  * **Action:** In `morphogenetic_engine/cli_dashboard.py`, add instance variables to the `RichDashboard` class to store the state of the UI (e.g., `self.latest_metrics`, `self.seed_states`). Create the public methods (`update_metrics`, `update_seed_state`, `set_phase`) that will be called by the logger. These methods should update the new instance variables.
  * **Deliverable:** The `cli_dashboard.py` file with the new instance variables and data-consuming methods.
  * **Verification:** The new methods can be unit-tested. Create a test in `tests/test_cli_dashboard.py` that instantiates the dashboard, calls a method like `update_metrics` with sample data, and asserts that the corresponding instance variable (`self.latest_metrics`) was updated correctly.

* **Task 3.2: Implement the Event Dispatcher in `ExperimentLogger`**
  * **Action:** In `morphogenetic_engine/logger.py`, fully implement the `_send_to_dashboard` method. This method will act as a dispatcher, inspecting the `EventType` of each incoming `LogEvent` and calling the appropriate consumer method on the `self.dashboard` object (e.g., if `event_type` is `EPOCH_PROGRESS`, call `self.dashboard.update_metrics(...)`).
  * **Deliverable:** The completed `_send_to_dashboard` method in `logger.py`.
  * **Verification:** Run an experiment. Add temporary `print()` statements inside the `RichDashboard` consumer methods (`update_metrics`, etc.) to prove they are being successfully called by the logger's dispatch mechanism.

---

### **Phase 4: Render Data in the UI Panels**

**Goal:** Connect the dashboard's internal state to the `rich` renderables, bringing the UI to life.

* **Task 4.1: Wire the Metrics and Info Panels**
  * **Action:** In `cli_dashboard.py`, modify the `_create_metrics_table_panel` method to generate a `rich.Table` using the data from `self.latest_metrics`. Ensure the `update_metrics` method triggers a panel refresh.
  * **Deliverable:** The implemented rendering logic for the metrics panel in `cli_dashboard.py`.
  * **Verification:** Run the experiment. The "Metrics Table" in the live dashboard should now populate and update with new values at the end of each training epoch.

* **Task 4.2: Wire the Seed Box and Network Strain Panels**
  * **Action:** Implement the `_create_seed_box_panel` and `_create_network_strain_panel` methods. They will read from `self.seed_states` to render the grid of seed statuses and their corresponding strain/drift values. Ensure the `update_seed_state` method triggers a refresh of these panels.
  * **Deliverable:** The implemented rendering logic for the seed-related panels in `cli_dashboard.py`.
  * **Verification:** Run the experiment. As seeds are activated or change state, the "Seed Box" and "Network Strain" panels in the UI should update their visual state (e.g., emojis, colors) in real-time.

* **Task 4.3: Wire the Event Log Panel**
  * **Action:** Implement the `_create_event_log_panel` to render a list of events stored in an instance variable (e.g., `self.event_log_messages`). Ensure that methods like `set_phase` and `add_live_event` append messages to this list and trigger a refresh.
  * **Deliverable:** The implemented rendering logic for the event log panel in `cli_dashboard.py`.
  * **Verification:** Run the experiment. The "Event Log" panel should display a running list of major events like phase transitions and germinations as they occur.
