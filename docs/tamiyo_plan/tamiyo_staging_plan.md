# Tamiyo Implementation Staging Plan v1.0

## Overview

This document outlines the phased transformation of the current basic morphogenetic engine into the full Kasmina system as specified in the curriculum. The implementation is broken into 6 stages, each building incrementally toward the final vision.

## Current State Analysis

**What we have:**
- Basic SeedManager singleton with thread-safe operations
- SentinelSeed with residual MLP architecture and soft-landing blending
- Simple KasminaMicro controller using plateau detection
- BaseNet with 8 fixed seed positions
- ExperimentLogger with structured JSON events
- Support for 5 dataset types (spirals, moons, clusters, spheres, complex_moons)
- Basic drift tracking via cosine similarity
- 85%+ test coverage on core components

**What we need:**
- Policy network replacing KasminaMicro
- Blueprint library with 16+ module types
- Comprehensive telemetry system
- Hardware simulation and safety constraints
- Progressive curriculum stages
- Reward system and intensity control
- Advanced validation pipeline
