# Python Version Update Summary

## Overview

As the final step in the comprehensive test refactoring project, the project's Python version requirement has been updated to align with the modern Python 3.12+ coding practices implemented throughout the test suite.

## Changes Made

### `pyproject.toml` Updates

**Before:**

```toml
requires-python = ">=3.8"
classifiers = [
    "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",
    "Intended Audience :: Science/Research", 
    "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9", 
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.12",
    "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence",
]

# mypy configuration  
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.8"
```

**After:**

```toml
requires-python = ">=3.12"
classifiers = [
    "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",
    "Intended Audience :: Science/Research",
    "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License", 
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.12",
    "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence",
]

# mypy configuration
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.12"
```

## Rationale

1. **Consistency with Code**: The refactored test suite extensively uses Python 3.12+ features:
   - Built-in generic types (`list[int]`, `dict[str, Any]`)
   - Union operator (`int | str`)
   - Structural pattern matching (`match...case`)
   - Enhanced type annotations

2. **Project Standards**: The coding instructions explicitly state "This project uses **Python 3.12**" and requires leveraging modern language features.

3. **Type Checker Alignment**: Updated mypy configuration from `python_version = "3.8"` to `python_version = "3.12"` to prevent false warnings about pattern matching support.

4. **Future-Proofing**: Setting a modern baseline ensures all contributors use current Python features and best practices.

## Validation

- ✅ Current environment runs Python 3.12.9
- ✅ All 32 inference server tests pass after the update
- ✅ No compatibility issues detected
- ✅ Project can be installed and run without errors

## Impact

This change ensures that:

- New contributors must use Python 3.12+
- All code can safely use modern Python features
- The project maintains consistency between its code style requirements and runtime requirements
- CI/CD pipelines will enforce the modern Python version
