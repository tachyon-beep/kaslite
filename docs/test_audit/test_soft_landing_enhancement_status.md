    seed = SentinelSeed("s1", 4, seed_manager)
```

**After:**
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_seed_manager(mocker):
    """Provide a properly mocked SeedManager for unit testing."""
    mock_manager = mocker.create_autospec(SeedManager, spec_set=True)
    # ... comprehensive mock setup

class TestSoftLandingStateTransitions:
    def test_training_to_blending_transition(self, mock_seed_manager, test_tensor):

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Mock-Based Unit Testing**

**Before (Integration-Heavy):**
```python
def test_training_to_blending():
    seed_manager = SeedManager()  # Real dependency
    seed = SentinelSeed("s1", 4, seed_manager)
    # Test coupled to SeedManager implementation
```

**After (Isolated Unit Tests):**
```python
def test_training_to_blending_transition(self, mock_seed_manager, test_tensor):
    mock_seed_manager.seeds = {"test_seed": {"buffer": [], "alpha": 0.0, "state": "training"}}
    seed = SentinelSeed("test_seed", 4, mock_seed_manager)
    # Test focuses purely on SentinelSeed logic
```

### 2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**

**Added Critical Tests:**
```python
def test_training_with_nan_input(self, mock_seed_manager):
    """Test that NaN inputs are handled gracefully."""
    # Tests previously missing error conditions

def test_corrupted_state_recovery(self, mock_seed_manager):
    """Test recovery from corrupted SeedManager state."""
    # Tests system resilience
```

### 3. **Performance Benchmarking**

**Added Performance Validation:**
```python
def test_state_transition_performance(self, mock_seed_manager, test_tensor):
    """Test that state transitions complete within performance bounds."""
    start_time = time.time()
    # ... perform transition
    duration = time.time() - start_time
    assert duration < 0.001  # Sub-millisecond requirement
```

### 4. **Modern Fixture Architecture**

**Comprehensive Fixture System:**
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_seed_manager(mocker):
    """Provide a properly mocked SeedManager for unit testing."""
    # Centralized, reusable mock configuration

@pytest.fixture  
def test_tensor():
    """Provide consistent test tensors."""
    # Standardized test data

@pytest.fixture
def performance_seed(mock_seed_manager):
    """Provide a performance-optimized seed for benchmarking."""
    # Specialized fixtures for different test types
```
