## Implementation Results

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅ COMPLETED

#### ✅ Proper Test Isolation Implemented
- **Mock Fixtures Added**: Comprehensive `mock_seed_manager` fixture with proper autospec
- **Test Classes Reorganized**: 8 focused test classes replacing single monolithic class
- **Dependency Injection**: All tests now use proper mocking for isolation

**Before:**
```python
def _create_seed_manager(self):
    return SeedManager()  # Real instance - integration test
```

**After:**
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_seed_manager(mocker):
    """Provide a properly mocked SeedManager for unit testing."""
    mock_manager = mocker.create_autospec(SeedManager, spec_set=True)
    mock_manager.seeds = mocker.MagicMock()
    mock_manager.record_transition = mocker.MagicMock()
    # ... comprehensive mock setup
```

#### ✅ Comprehensive Error Handling Added
- **Parameter Validation Tests**: Invalid dimensions, negative values, edge cases
- **State Corruption Tests**: Corrupted SeedManager state handling
- **Resource Exhaustion Tests**: Memory limits and CUDA out-of-memory simulation
- **Tensor Operation Tests**: Dimension mismatches and invalid operations

#### ✅ Modern Test Organization Implemented
- **Test Constants**: All magic numbers replaced with named constants
- **Fixture-Based Setup**: Comprehensive fixture ecosystem for test data
- **Class-Based Organization**: Logical grouping by functionality area

### Phase 2: Extended Coverage ✅ COMPLETED

- **Memory Usage Testing**: Training memory leak detection
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Forward pass timing validation  
- **Resource Cleanup**: State reset memory cleanup verification

#### ✅ Concurrency and Thread Safety

- **Concurrent Training**: Multi-threaded training step validation

#### ✅ Parametrized Testing
- **State Behavior Testing**: Parametrized forward pass behavior across all states
- **State Transition Testing**: Parametrized transition validation
- **Property-Based Testing**: Hypothesis-driven parameter validation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features ✅ COMPLETED

#### ✅ Property-Based Testing with Hypothesis
- **Parameter Space Exploration**: Automatic testing across valid parameter ranges
- **Edge Case Discovery**: Hypothesis-driven edge case identification
- **Deadline Management**: Proper timeout and health check configuration

#### ✅ Integration Scenarios
