"""
Comprehensive test suite for the run_morphogenetic_experiment script.

This module previously provided backward compatibility by importing all test classes
from the refactored test modules. The tests have been split into smaller,
more manageable files:

- test_datasets.py: Dataset generation tests
- test_training.py: Training and evaluation tests
- test_cli.py: CLI argument parsing and main function tests
- test_integration.py: Integration and architecture scaling tests

For new development, import directly from the specific test modules.
This file is now empty to avoid duplicate test execution.
"""

# All tests have been moved to specific test modules
# to avoid duplication and maintain better organization.
# Import directly from test_cli.py, test_datasets.py, etc. as needed.
